# Twitter Follower Counter

Twitter bot that goes through all recent tweets and searches for tweets with memphis related hashtags. Once a tweet is found, the bot checked if the user set their location to Memphis, TN: if it was, the bot recorded their username and follower count.

Ran this for about 2 days continuously and got 2050 data points.
